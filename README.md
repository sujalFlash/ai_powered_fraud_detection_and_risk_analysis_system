#   AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

##  Description

This project implements an AI-powered system for detecting fraudulent financial transactions. It utilizes a deep learning model (MFF CNN) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, leveraging Python, PyTorch, and cloud-based data processing and storage technologies. The system incorporates data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation components, along with elements of a data pipeline.

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* AWS (S3, Redshift) - For data storage and warehousing
* Apache Airflow - For workflow orchestration
* Kafka - For real-time data streaming (if applicable in your implementation)
* Scikit-learn - For any traditional ML tasks or preprocessing

##  Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    * Python 3.x
    * Pip package manager
    * AWS account (if using AWS services)
    * (Optional) Docker

2.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_URL>
    cd AI-Powered-Fraud-Detection
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
4.   ** Apache airflow installation"
     ```python shell
        import sys
        import subprocess
        AIRFLOW_VERSION="2.10.5" #recent version"
        PYTHON_VERSION=f"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}"
        CONSTRAINT_URL=f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-{AIRFLOW_VERSION}/constraints-{PYTHON_VERSION}.txt"
        print(f"airflow version:{AIRFLOW_VERSION}")
        print(f"python version:{PYTHON_VERSION}")
        print(f"Constraint URL:{CONSTRAINT_URL}")
        try:
              subprocess.check_call(["pip","install",f"apache-airflow=={AIRFLOW_VERSION}","--constraint",CONSTRAINT_URL])
              print("Airflow installed successfully")
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
              print(f"error install airflow:{e}")
        
4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up AWS credentials (if applicable):**

    * Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.
    * Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access S3 and Redshift.

6.  **(Optional) Docker setup:**

    * If a `Dockerfile` is provided, you can build and run the project using Docker.
    * Install Docker.
    * Build the Docker image:
        ```bash
        docker build -t fraud-detection .
        ```
    * Run the Docker container:
        ```bash
        docker run -it fraud-detection
        ```

##  Data Preparation

1.  **Obtain the dataset:**

    * Place your financial transaction dataset in the `data/` directory.
    * Ensure the data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
    * If you need to simulate data, describe the process here.

2.  **Data preprocessing:**

    * Run the data preprocessing scripts in the `src/data_processing/` directory.
    * These scripts may handle tasks such as:
        * Cleaning the data (handling missing values, etc.).
        * Feature engineering.
        * Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

##  Model Training

1.  **Train the MFF CNN model:**

    * Execute the model training scripts in the `src/model/` directory.
    * You may need to adjust hyperparameters or training parameters.

2.  **Model evaluation:**

    * After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
    * Record the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

##  Data Pipeline (If Applicable)

1.  **Airflow setup:**

    * If using Apache Airflow, ensure Airflow is installed and configured.
    * Place your Airflow DAGs (if any) in the `src/pipeline/` directory.
    * Configure the DAGs to connect to your data sources (e.g., S3) and processing resources (e.g., Redshift).

2.  **Kafka integration (If Applicable):**

    * If using Kafka for real-time data streaming, ensure Kafka is set up and running.
    * Configure the data ingestion components to consume data from Kafka topics.

##  Usage

1.  **Running the system:**

    * To run the fraud detection system, execute the main script:

        ```bash
        python src/main.py
        ```

    * This script may handle the end-to-end process, including data ingestion, preprocessing, fraud prediction, and outputting results.

2.  **Configuration:**

    * Configuration parameters (e.g., file paths, model hyperparameters, database connection details) may be specified in a configuration file or through environment variables.
    * Document any configuration options here.

##  Results/Evaluation

* The MFF CNN model achieved the following performance metrics on a test dataset:
    * Accuracy: \[Your Accuracy Value]
    * Precision: \[Your Precision Value]
    * Recall: \[Your Recall Value]
    * F1-Score: \[Your F1-Score]
* Further evaluation details or visualizations can be found in the `reports/` directory (if applicable).

##  Challenges and Solutions

* **Imbalanced Data:**
    * Challenge: Fraudulent transactions are typically rare, leading to imbalanced datasets.
    * Solution: \[Describe the techniques you used to handle imbalanced data, e.g., oversampling, undersampling, class weighting.]
* \[Add any other significant challenges and how you addressed them.]

##  Future Improvements

* Implement real-time fraud detection using Kafka.
* Improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning or different model architectures.
* Develop a user interface for visualizing fraud detection results.
* Integrate with a real-time alerting system.
